# Buying-Cars

Haha I'm trying to avoid all the weird 2D matrix questions so I'm trying to get these out of the way. This one was okay-ish.

***Question: Given a list of integers prices representing prices of cars for sale, and a budget k, return the maximum number of cars you can buy.***

Basically what I did is sort the list and keep summing it till the sum overflows from the budget provided. I added a counter to count the number of additions being made and returned the counter. 

Apparently it's not very quick code ðŸ˜ž but yknow whatever.
